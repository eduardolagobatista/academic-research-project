Codings and paper generated for the thesis submission at the University of São Paulo, on december/2019

The pdf file is the academic article created as thesis for the graduation on Aeronautical Engineering at the University of São Paulo on December/2019. It contains the necessary bibliography revision for the development, as well as the detailed description of the steps followed to create the codes.

This work was intended to create a tool inside the Finite Element software Abaqus, that would be able to help research about new composite materials. The tool is capable of creating several Artificial Micorstructes (geometries), using the concepts of Representative Volume Element and Periodic Boundary Conditions to simulate the behaviour of composite materials subjected to temperature gradients. 

At this moment, this tool is only capable of implementing regular geometric arrangements, but further developments will also implement random microstructures. 

The codes created should be executed in ther order: Cell, Mirror, Constraints, Analysis and Report

Any doubts, feel free to contact me.
